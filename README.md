# Course Management Platform (CMP)

About
-----------------------------------------------------

I want to create a course management platform for students where they can 
store everything related to their course in one place. This means they can 
enter the semester from the following options - WT1 _(Winter Term 1)_, 
WT2 _(Winter Term 2)_, ST1 _(Summer Term 1)_, ST2 _(Summer Term 2)_. After 
entering the semester, students can add their **course code**, **course number**, 
number of **credits** the course is worth. There will also be an option to add
the **location** of the course and its **timing**.
