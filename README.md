# Course Management Platform (CMP)

About
-----------------------------------------------------

I want to create a course management platform for students where they can 
store everything related to their course in one place. This means they can 
enter the semester from the following options - WT1 _(Winter Term 1)_, 
WT2 _(Winter Term 2)_, ST1 _(Summer Term 1)_, ST2 _(Summer Term 2)_. After 
entering the semester, students can add their **course code**, **course number**, 
number of **credits** the course is worth. There will also be an option to add
the **location** of the course and its **timing**. Currently, it is a very
simple project, but I wish to develop and expand it further to create something 
which will help many students.

This application will be used by students like myself. This project is 
particularly of interest to me because when I transitioned from high school
to university, it was a really big change for me. It felt like a lot at the
beginning but good planning and time management really helped me find my 
place here. Another reason why I want to pursue this project is that few of 
my courses have their details in one place whereas few others have their 
details elsewhere, like some of them use only one website to keep all the 
details whereas some have multiple websites for different things like 
submitting assignments, checking grades and other things. So, it gets somewhat
difficult to keep track of everything in your head and that's why I hope to 
create an application which removes these barriers and keeps everything in one 
place.
